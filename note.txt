Validating Craete Task form

Here's a 7-line explanation of the validation logic:

1. **Title Check**: Ensures the task title isn't empty or just whitespace.
2. **Description Check**: Confirms the task description is provided.
3. **Due Date Check**: Makes sure a due date is selected.
4. **Assigned User Check**: Validates that at least one team member is assigned.
5. **Checklist Check**: Ensures there's at least one item in the to-do checklist.
6. **Task ID Check**: If a task ID exists, it updates an existing task.
7. **Create Task Fallback**: If no task ID is found, it proceeds to create a new task.
