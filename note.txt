INTEGRATING CREATE TASK API


Here's the 10-line explanation:

1. Sets loading state when task creation begins  
2. Transforms checklist items into proper format with completion status  
3. Prepares API payload with task data and formatted due date  
4. Converts dueDate to ISO string format for backend compatibility  
5. Makes POST request to task creation endpoint with processed data  
6. Shows success notification upon successful task creation  
7. Clears form data after successful submission  
8. Handles errors with appropriate error notification  
9. Ensures loading state is reset in both success and error cases  
10. Uses try-catch-finally pattern for robust error handling  

This function efficiently handles task creation with checklist processing and date formatting.
