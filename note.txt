Creating Summary section

This JSX code renders an **Admin Dashboard summary section** using a layout and info cards. Here's the explanation in 7 lines:

1. `DashboardLayout` wraps the content, with the "Dashboard" menu marked active.
2. A greeting shows the logged-in user's name (`user?.name`) and todayâ€™s date using `moment()`.
3. The `InfoCard` components display summarized task data (Total, Pending, In Progress, Completed).
4. Data comes from `dashboardData.charts.taskDistribution`, using optional chaining to avoid crashes.
5. `addThousandsSeparator()` formats numbers for better readability (e.g., 1,000).
6. Each card has a distinct color (`bg-primary`, `bg-violet-500`, etc.) to visually differentiate statuses.
7. The grid layout adjusts responsively across screen sizes (`grid-cols-2`, `md:grid-cols-4`, etc.).
