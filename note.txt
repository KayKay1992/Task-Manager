Here’s a 10-line explanation of the CreateTask component:

Imports various utilities, components, and hooks (useState, useNavigate, custom inputs) used for building the task creation form.

Initializes state for the task form (taskData), which includes title, description, priority, due date, assigned users, checklist, and attachments.

Handles value updates using handleValueChange, which updates specific fields in the form state.

Renders a form UI inside a DashboardLayout, dynamically switching between "Create Task" and "Update Task" based on taskId.

Inputs include text fields for title and description, select dropdowns for priority, date input, user selection, checklist, and attachments.

Delete option is shown when updating an existing task (i.e., when taskId is available).

Handles submission via handleSubmit, where error checking and data processing logic would go.

Placeholder async functions for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching tasks are included but not yet implemented.

Conditional error display shows any validation or backend errors.

Final submit button dynamically changes label based on whether the task is being created or updated.
