Integrating Update Task API

Here's a 10-line explanation of the `updateTask` function:

1. Starts async function to update a task and sets loading state to true.  
2. Maps through `taskData.todoChecklist` to preserve completion status of existing tasks.  
3. For each item, checks if it existed in the original task (`currentTask`).  
4. Creates new checklist items keeping completed status if task existed, defaulting to false otherwise.  
5. Sends PUT request to update task endpoint with modified task data.  
6. Converts dueDate to ISO string format for API compatibility.  
7. Includes the processed checklist in the update payload.  
8. Shows success toast notification if update succeeds.  
9. Catches and logs any errors during the process.  
10. Finally turns off loading state whether successful or not.
