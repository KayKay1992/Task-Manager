Integrating API_PATHS

Sure! Here's a 10-line explanation of your code:

1. `BASE_URL` defines the base server address for API requests, useful for setting the root endpoint.
2. `API_PATHS` is an object that organizes all the API routes of the app in a structured way.
3. `AUTH` section contains endpoints for user registration, login, and fetching the profile of the logged-in user.
4. `USERS` section includes routes for admins to manage user data like retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting users.
5. Some routes like `GET_USER_BY_ID` and `UPDATE_USER` use functions to insert dynamic user IDs into the path.
6. `TASKS` section groups endpoints for managing tasks, like creating, updating, fetching, and deleting them.
7. It also includes specific task operations like updating status and managing task checklists.
8. `REPORTS` section provides export features, allowing admins to download task or user reports in Excel format.
9. `IMAGE` section includes an endpoint for image upload, likely for user profile pictures or task attachments.
10. This modular and clean setup helps maintain and scale the frontend app when interacting with the backend APIs.
