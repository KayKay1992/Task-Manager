Download Detailed Task Report.

Hereâ€™s a 10-line summary of the `handleDownloadReport` function:

1. The function `handleDownloadReport` is used to download a task report as an Excel file.
2. It sends a GET request to the `EXPORT_TASKS` API endpoint using Axios.
3. The `responseType: 'blob'` ensures the file is received in binary format.
4. A Blob URL is created from the response data using `window.URL.createObjectURL`.
5. An anchor (`<a>`) element is dynamically created and its `href` set to the Blob URL.
6. The `download` attribute is set to name the file as `task_details.xlsx`.
7. The anchor is temporarily added to the document and clicked to start the download.
8. After the download is triggered, the anchor is removed from the DOM.
9. The Blob URL is revoked to free up memory.
10. If there's an error, it logs it and shows a toast error message.
