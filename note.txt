Explaining the customBarchart component

This React component renders a customizable bar chart using the `recharts` library.  
It accepts `data` as a prop and dynamically colors each bar based on the `priority` level using the `getBarColor` function.  
The `CustomToolTip` function displays a styled tooltip showing the priority and count when hovering over a bar.  
The `ResponsiveContainer` ensures the chart adapts to its parent container's size, making it mobile-friendly.  
The `BarChart` includes X and Y axes, a transparent cursor, and rounded bars with individual coloring via the `<Cell>` component.  
Grid lines are disabled for a cleaner appearance (`stroke='none'`).  
Tooltips are styled and shown only when active and payload exists.  
Each bar's height corresponds to a `count` value from the data.  
The legend is omitted for simplicity, but could be added for clarity.  
This chart is ideal for visualizing priority-based metrics like task urgency distribution.
