EXPLAIN TaskListTable component
Here’s a 10-line explanation of your TaskListTable component:

This React component displays a list of recent loans in a styled table format.

It takes tableData as a prop, which is an array of loan objects.

The getStatusBadgeColor function returns Tailwind CSS classes based on loan status.

The getpriorityBadgeColor function assigns color styles depending on priority.

A responsive priority rendered with columns for Name, Amount, Status, Loan Type, and Created On.

If tableData is empty, a row saying “No recent task found” is shown.

Each loan row shows the user’s name, formatted amount (₦), and status with a color badge.
Loan type is displayed with a corresponding color-coded badge as well.
Creation date is formatted using moment.js for readability (e.g., "1st Jan 2025").
The component is exported as default and can be reused wherever recent loan data is needed.
