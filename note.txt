API call to fetch dashboard Data.

the states we used

dashboardData: stores the full dashboard payload from the backend.
pieChartData & barChartData: likely to hold specific data for visual charts (though not set yet in this snippet).

📡 getDashboardData Function
Makes a GET request using your axiosInstance to the API path defined as GET_DASHBOARD_DATA, likely something like /api/task/dashboard-data.
If successful, stores the result in dashboardData state.
If it fails, logs an error.

🔁 useEffect Hook
This ensures getDashboardData runs once when the component mounts.
The empty dependency array ([]) means it won’t run again unless the component is remounted.

🧠 Summary
This setup is standard in React apps to fetch data as soon as a page or dashboard loads.
Right now, the chart states (pieChartData, barChartData) are unused — maybe the intention is to process dashboardData later and populate them.
