Calling Get Task details by Id API


1. This code defines an async function `getTaskByID` that fetches task details by ID.  
2. It uses `axiosInstance` to make a GET request to an API endpoint with the given `taskId`.  
3. If the response contains data, it stores the task info in `currentTask` using `setCurrentTask`.  
4. It updates `taskData` state with structured task details like title, description, and priority.  
5. The `dueDate` is formatted using `moment` for consistent display.  
6. `assignedTo` maps assigned user IDs, defaulting to an empty array if none exist.  
7. `todoChecklist` extracts checklist item texts, defaulting to an empty array.  
8. `attachments` includes task attachments or an empty array if none.  
9. Errors during fetching are logged to the console.  
10. A `useEffect` hook triggers `getTaskByID` whenever `taskId` changes, ensuring data reloads when the ID updates.
